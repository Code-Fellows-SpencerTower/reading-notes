# Express REST API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
    - Authentication, add server time, changing request path
2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?
    - False
3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
    - call res.send
4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
    - between req being received and res being sent
5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
    - res.send is called twice
