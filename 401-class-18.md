## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe a use case for a serverless function.
    - needing to dynamically scale up or down server instances to support an app
2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
    - create a system that relied on functions that respond to events and carried out actions such as updating or provisioning resources when triggered
3. Describe how a CDN works
    - distributed servers that allow for rapid transfer of content
    - does not host content
    - replace servers at exchange points in a network
