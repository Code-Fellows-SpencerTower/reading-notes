- controlling images in CSS:
- adjust width and height, just like any other box
- specify image size
- same image of diff sizes - use ids like small, med, large
- can reference intended alignement of image in class or id
- images are inline elements by default (flow with text)
- to center - change to block-level with `display: block`
  - use `text-align: center` on the containing element to center the img
  - or on img use `margin` and set left and right to auto
- `background-image` - lets you put an img behind any element
  - will repeat by default to fill the container
- `background-repeat` - set to no-repeat to show image once
- `background-attachment` - fixed = image stays in same position
- scroll - background img moves with scrolling
