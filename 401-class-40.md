1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
    - Ducks: Redux Reducer Bundles
        - a way to organize a scalable Redux file system
    - Redux Toolkit: official, opinionated toolset for Redux
        - toolset with utility funcitons to simplify using Redux
        - allows you to set up stores, reducers, create slices of state without having to write actions or types.

## Vocabulary Terms

- redux toolkit slices
  - slices of state that are automatically generated by `createSlice` in Redux toolkit
  - `createSlice` takes initial state, object of reducer functions, and slice name
  - it creates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state passed in
  - source: [https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice)

- namespace
  - a way to prevent collisions by providing scope to identifiers such as the names of types, functions, variables, etc
