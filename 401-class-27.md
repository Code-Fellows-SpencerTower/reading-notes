# useState() Hook

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?
    - functionality is divided into components in React
    - a component re-renders everytime a change is made to a component in React
    - React uses state
1. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?
    - Functional components use hooks such as `useState()` to manage state. Class components use a constructor with `this.state` to manage state. Functional components also accept props as an argument.

  - use `useState()` to maintain state
  - accept props as an argument
  - are more efficient than class components
  - cannot use Reac lifecyle methods such as componentDidMount
