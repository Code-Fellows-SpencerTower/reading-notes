# Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
    - react app pages re-render to update with new content
1. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
    - Inside the <BrowserRouter />, because it is the parent router component so the component will render with all child components
1. What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
    - ignores the other components
1. What does props.children contain?
    - content between the opening and closing tags of the containing component
1. How do useState() and this.setState() differ?
    - for useState(), deconstruction is used to define the state's variable and updating function

## Vocab Terms

- State Hook
  - can only be used inside function components, needs to be imported from react, lets you add state to function components, an initial value can be passed into the `useState()` parentheses
  - can declare a new state variable and function to update it via deconstruction:
    - `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`

- Mounting and Un-Mounting
  - the `useEffect()` hook allows you to use side effects within function components
