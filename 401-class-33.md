## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is the Context API useful?
    - it allows you to pass down state without having to pass props through each component layer
2. Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
    - No, context can only be accessed by child components of the provider
3. What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
    - If you need to make a UI theme available throughout a website
4. Describe “Context Hell”
    - When you have multiple types of Context being used by the same components
    - This can result in multiple layers of wrapping around child components in the provider context
