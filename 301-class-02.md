# React Lifecycle

[React Component Lifecycle Events](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

    - The render occurs before componentDidMount in the Mounting phase of the component lifecycle
    - render occurs in the Render Phase, componentDidMount occurs in the Commit Phase

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

    - a React component constructor is called to initialize a component
    - don't use this.setState() in the constructor - it will ignore prop updates


3. Put the following things in the order that they happen:  constructor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount

4. What does componentDidMount do?

    - used for loading things that use a network request or initialize the DOM
    - where subscriptions should be set up
        - use componentWillUnmount() to unsubscribe
    - it will be invoked right after a component has been mounted


Lifecycle event = a method used on a component that has beed defined as a class or function in React
    - lets you update the UI and 'application states'

Mounting Phase
    - first phase of the component lifecycle
    - occurs when a component is created and then inserted in the DOM

Updating Phase
    - second phase of the component lifecycle
    - when a component is updated it is rerendered

Unmounting Phase
    - third and final phase of the component lifecycle
    - gets called when a component is removed from the DOM
    - componentWillUnmount is called, only event of the phase



[React State vs Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)


1. What types of things can you pass in the props?

    - similar arguments for a function
    - counters - initial count would be passed in with props - current
    - state would be set to the initial count and would handle updating the counter inside of the component

2. What is the big difference between props and state?

    - Props - passed into a component
    - handled/changed outside of a component
    - used for things that are passed down to child components and don't change - eg a header

    - State - something inside a component
    - handled inside the component
    - app will rerender after state is changed
    - state is useful when you

3. When do we re-render our application?

    - after the data has changed / the state has changed

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

    - data that is subject to change
      - counter/timer
      - video game input - e.g. actions

## Things I Want To Know More About

- Is 'application state' basically the current state of data that is subject to change?
- It sounds like state and props are used in conjunction with one another, and it's not so much a choice of one over the other. My impression is that they are handling different aspects of the component. Props are passed into the component/handled outside, while state is handled within the component and, as mentioned in the 'counter' example of the video, would pickup where props left off by updating the state/data of the counter as needed. Need some more clarification on this.
