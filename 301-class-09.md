# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

[Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1. What is functional programming?
    - from https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa: "a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data"
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    - The function return values that are the same for identical arguments.
    - Impure function: eg a function that uses a global object in its calculations that is not passed in as a parameter of the function
    - The function does not cause any side-effects
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
    - testing code is easier
    - can do unit testing on pure functions in different contexts
4. What is immutability?
    - inability to be changed
    - the function shouldnt alter the original value of the argument passed in. 
    - eg: value + 2, if value is passed in as an argument and needs to be incremented
5. What is Referential transparency?
    - a function that consistently returns the same result given the same input as arguments
    - requires a pure function and immutibility to be referentially transparent

1. What is a module?
    - a logical section of code that can be called on when it is needed to execute code
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
    - allows you to import/read JS modules that exist in separate files
    - it reads the file, executes the files contents, and then returns the exports object
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
    - with require('file path')
    - dont have to put .js on the end of the file
    - eg `let functionName = require(filePath);`
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
    - export the file to make it available to other files with the 'export' keyword to make it available for require/import
    - `module.exports = <function you want to be available outside fof the module>`
