[React Docs - Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

1. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
    - a component should only have one function
    - if you add to the component it should be broken into subcomponents
    - each component should correspond to one section of the data model
        - organize into a parent-child hierarchy
        - structure based on mock
    - build a static application first
2. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
    - build a version of your app that renders the UI but does not have interactivity
    - allows you to separate the process of adding the static UI from the process of adding interactivity
    - Static - UI, props, render() methods
    - Interactivity - state
    - can start building top-down or bottom-up in the component hierarchy
    - simple projects - top-down
    - larger projects - bottom-up
3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
    - interactivity / state
4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
    - from "https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html":
      - Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
      - Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
      - Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
        - eg a filtered list that can be determined by combining the original list with user input is not state
5. How can you identify where state needs to live?
    - find each component that uses that state to render something
    - find the common parent of those components
    - that parent or one component higher in the hierarchy should own the state
    - if no common parent then you can make a component solely to own the state

[Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

1. What is a “higher-order function”?
    - functions that act on other functions
    -  either return functions or take them as arguments
    - 
2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
    - line 2 creates and returns a new function using the argument 'n'
3. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
    - map takes an array and uses a function to modify the elements in the original array, producing an array with the same number of elements, but different content
