# Introduction to React and Components

[Component Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

1. What is a “component”?

  - A React component is an individual piece of code that defines a certain set of functionalities. Components are typically assigned to a specific interface. Components are designed to operate independently and be reused.
  - 3 views: object-oriented, conventional, process-related

2. What are the characteristics of a component?

  - Reusability - components are typically made to be reusable in various scenarios
  - Replaceable - components are interchangable with other components that serve a similar function
  - Non-context specific - created to function in multiple contexts, not limited to a specific context
  - Extensible - new components with new functionality can be built off pre-existing components - shouldn't have to modify the existing component
  - Encapsulated - designed to keep the internal functionality and variables of the application hidden to callers
  - Independent - can operate in isolation

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

  - Deployment - becuase components operate independently, it is easier to replace components without disrupting the rest of the application
  - Reduced cost - ability to use 3rd-party components reduces maintenance and dev expenses
  - Development - development is made easier by using components that operate independently
  - Reusability - the same components can be used in multiple contexts, which reduces time/expenses for development and deployment
  - Modification of technical complexity - component containers reduce application complexity
  - Reliability - reuse of reliable components increases the overall reliabliity of the system
  - System maintenance and evolution - components are independent of one another, so components can be modified/replaced without having to update other parts of the system

[What is Props and How to Use it in React](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0)

1. What is “props” short for?
  - Properties
  - "props" is a keyword used in React when passing data between components

2. How are props used in React?
  - Props are used to pass data from one component to another
  - can use interpolation {} to define new attributes and values
  - the value is written inside curly braces
  - allows us to add the same property to same component with different values

3. What is the flow of props?
  - Uni-directional - data flows from parent to child
  - Props data in React is also read-only, so child components that receive data from parent components cannot change the data

## Things I want to know more about

- How is encapsulation achieved? / How can a lack of encapsulation be exploited?
- How do you know when your component is sufficiently encapsulated?
- Are there any times when you need a child component to pass data to a parent component? If so, how would this be done?
