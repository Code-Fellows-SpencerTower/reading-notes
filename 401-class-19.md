# AWS: Events

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server
    - Both allow for creation of RESTful APIs and two-way communication applications
    - [aws - api gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
1. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
    - RDS - relational database - good for MySQL
    - DynamoDB - serverless database - for high performance
    - Redshift - data warehousing
    - ElasiCache - in-memory data store services
    - MemoryDB - Redis-compatible, in-memory database - ultra-fast performance
    - DocumentDB - fully managed database service for MongoDB

    - the client sends a confirmation message back to the server upon receipt

## Vocab Terms

- Serverless API
  - an API hosted in a cloud environment
- Triggers
  - conditions that cause code to run and carry out an action
- Dynamo vs Mongo
  - both are NoSQL databases
  - DynamoDB is owned by AWS - limited to AWS environment
  - MongoDB is not tied to any specific platform
    - can be configured to run anywhere
  - AWS manages the scaling of DynamoDB
  - Users have to manage scaling for MongoDB
