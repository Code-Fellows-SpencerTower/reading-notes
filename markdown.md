# Markdown

Markdown is a syntax used to format text.

It differs from Word in that it is not WYSIWYG. The edited markdown document will be rendered to show text formatting.
It makes it easy to do simple formatting such as making lists, tables, adding links, bolding and italicizing text, headers, etc.

Markdown is often used in comments on GitHub as well as .md files

.md is the extension for a markdown file

*italics* are made by wrapping text with * or _
**bolded** text is wrapped with ** or __

Headers are formatted with #
# # for H1 -> ###### for H6

Unordered lists are formatted with a single * for each item in the list
Ordered lists are formatted with 1. for each item
