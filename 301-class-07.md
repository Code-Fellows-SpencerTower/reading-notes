[How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
    - helped write the first web servers that distributed files accross the web. He helped write HTTP.
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    - Because now machines are using the web similar to how people use it, they use web protocols to transfer information to eachother
    - machine-to-machine communication is different from the requirements laid out by Fielding when the web was designed becuase machines only needed to communiate in small groups, not all machines communicating all at once.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    - REST - provides a definition of a resource on the web
4. What does a `GET` do?
    - common HTTP method
    - requests data from a source
    - can be cached, bookmarked, stay in browser history
    - shouldn't be used with sensitive data
5. What does a `POST` do?
    - sends data to server to create or update a resource on another system
    - gets stored in request body of HTTP request
6. What does `PUT` do?
    - used to replace data on another system
7. What does `PATCH` do?
    - makes partial changes to a system
