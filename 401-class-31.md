## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()
    - use useReducer when you are using state that has multiple sub-values.
    - useState is more useful when you have simple, singular state values

1. Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

1. What do custom hooks usually do?
    - handling, animation, timers, etc.
    - source: [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html#:~:text=Custom%20Hooks%20offer%20the%20flexibility,more%20we%20haven't%20considered.)
1. Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
    - useToggle
    - receives a boolean as parameter, generates the opposite action
    - useful when you want to take the opposite action when the action is triggered by a true/false condition
      - e.g. opening/closing a modal or menu

1. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
    - it would use axios to query an api and store the response in state
