## Opertors and Loops

### Assignment Operators

- `=` assigns variable to a value
- `+=` adds value to existing value held in variable and assigns combined value to that variable
- `**` exponent
- `%` remainder
- `x << y` left shift assignment
- `x >> y` right shift assignment
- `&&` = AND
- `||` = OR
- `??` = nullish coalescing operator

Destructuring: `var [four, five, six] = 1` sets all elements of the list to 1

### Comparison Operators

- `==` equal to, returns true if values are equal
- `!=` not equal
- `===` strict equal - true if operands are both equal and the same data type
- `!==` strict not equal - true if operands are not equal but have the same data type, or have different data types
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to

### Arithmetic Operators

- `%` remainder
- `++` increment
- `--` decrement
- `-` unary negation, returns negation of value
- `+` unary plus, converts operand to a number, e.g. converts a string to a number
- `**` exponent operator

### Booleans

- `&&` AND
- `||` OR
- `!` NOT

### Urnary Operators

- `delete` deletes object's property
- `typeof` returns objects data type
- `void` evaluates an expression without returning a value

### Relational Operators

- `in` - checks for a property in an object

## Loops and Iteration

- `for`
- `do...while`
- `while`
- `for...in`
- `for...of`
- `labeled`
