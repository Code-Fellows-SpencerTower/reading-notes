# Access Control (ACL)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
    - basic auth is used during the initial user setup vs bearer auth is used for authenticating the user afterwards
2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
    - jwt - contains encoded JSON objects
    - used to share security info between a client and server

3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
    - needs to be random
    - avoid using UUID libraries - they use the timestamp / MAC address of the server generating the secret
    - use a cryptographically secure library, generate a 256-bit value, convert to hexadicimal representation
    - only store in enctypted or hashed version - keeps it secure

## Vocab Terms

- encryption - converting information / data into code
- token - a cryptographic string used to validate access to resources
- bearer - the user of the token - "bearer token" - must be sent in the Authorization header of the request to access resources, the token is a cryptographic string that is generated by the server in response to a login request
- bearer authentication - http authentication scheme involving security tokens
- source: [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/)
- secret - used to authenticate the client to they authorization server by OAuth. Known by client and server.
- JSON Web Token - "proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims." source: [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)
