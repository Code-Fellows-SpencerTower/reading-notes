# Context API - Behaviors

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?
    - You can use either one, but using a function component would allow you to utilize the useContext hook
1. What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?
    - when the global state does not change frequently
1. How can you best test context?
    - behavioral testing
    - test the provider and consumer together in jest
      - avoid using mocks
