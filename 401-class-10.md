# Stacks and Queues

[Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)

- Calls:
  - a function invocation
  - callstack: mostly used for function invocation calls
  - Uses Last in First Out principle
  - last one to be added to the stack is the first one to be popped out
  - one call at a time
  - call stacks are synchronous
  - imortant to understand how call stacks work for Asynchronous programming
- LIFO:
  - Last in First Out
- Stack Overflows:
  - if there is a recursive function that has no exit point
  - continually calls itself
