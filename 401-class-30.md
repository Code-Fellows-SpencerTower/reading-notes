# Hash Tables

## Terminology

- Hashtable: a data structure - an array that stores key value pairs for a hash in 'buckets'
- Hash: is a string that has been converted to a secure value that will be used as an index?
- Buckets: stored in each index of the array of the hashtable array, each bucket can contain multiple key/value pairs
- Collisions: when multiple keys end up being stored in the same index of the hashtable
- Chaining: utilizes a linked list to store multiple key/value pairs at the same index, one way to resolve collisions

## Uses

- Hashtables are used to quickly store and retreive hash values
- Efficient because the BigO is O(1) for looking up key/value pairs

## How it works

- referencing the index of the key/value pair directly is what makes hash tables efficient
- a hash function is used place the key/value pair at a specific location
- the hash function recieves the items key and generates the index where it should be placed in the hashtable
- the function receives the key, and generates a number based on the key
- this number is the bucket index/location for the key/value pair
- the same key should generate the same bucket index/output
- this index number allows quick reference with an efficiency of O(1)
