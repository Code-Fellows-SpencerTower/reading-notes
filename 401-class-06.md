## Research Questions

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
    - an object that can only be instantiated once
    - used when one instance is used to coordinate actions accross the system
    - source: [Wikipedia: Singleton Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)
2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
    - eg a database instantiated with Sequelize
    - `let db = new Sequelize(POSTGRES_URI);`
3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
    - create a class in a separate file - eg a Logger for console.log operations to be used throughout the system
    - export the class
    - instantiate a new object of the class in another file of the system that will use its functionality

## Vocabulary Terms

1. Router Middleware
    - code that runs inbetween the client request and server response
2. Dynamic Module Loading
    - "Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory."
    - "dynamic loading allows a computer program to start up in the absence of these libraries, to discover available libraries, and to potentially gain additional functionality."
    - source: [Wikipedia: Dynamic Loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading)
3. Singleton Pattern
    - an object that can only be instantiated once
    - used when one instance is used to coordinate actions accross the system
4. CRUD -> REST Method Matches
    - Create -> POST / PUT
    - Read -> GET
    - Update -> PUT / PATCH
    - Delete -> DELETE
5. Mock Testing
    - creating a fake version of an internal or external service to represent and test the real one
