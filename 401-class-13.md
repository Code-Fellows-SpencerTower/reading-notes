## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
    - a "pipeline" is created between the server and client
2. Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
    - it uses a Websocket connection but falls back on http if necessary
3. What happens when a client emits an event?
    - the event is recieved by the server socket
4. What happens when a server emits an event?
    - the event is sent to an individual socket or broadcast to multiple sockets
5. What happens if a client “misses” an event?
    - the event is ignored
6. How can we mitigate this?
    - always have clients listening for events with a callback to handle them
