## Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does

- Array.map() iterates through elements in an array an performs a user-defined operation one each one. Returns a new array.

## Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does

- Array.reduce() takes a user-defined callback function. The callback function then operates on each element in the array in order. The values from each operation are accumulated and returned as a single value.

## Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result
### With normal Promise .then() syntax

```Javascript
function getCharacters() {
  superagent.get('http://swapi.dev/api/people/')
    .then(data => {return data.body.results})
    .then(chars => {
      let nameUrlObj = {}
      for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i += 1) {
        nameUrlObj[chars[i].name] = chars[i].url;
      }
      return nameUrlObj;
    })
    .then(obj => {console.log(obj)})
}

getCharacters()
```

### Again with async / await syntax

```Javascript
async function cityLatLon(city) {
  const cityData = await superagent.get(`https://geocode.xyz/${city}?json=1`);
  const latt = cityData.body.latt;
  const longt = cityData.body.longt;
  console.log(`${city} Lat: ${latt} Lon: ${longt}`);
};

cityLatLon('Seattle');
```

## Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student

- Promises are basically objects that represent the completion of an asynchronous function. They return a state - pending (not yet carried out)fullfilled (operations successful), rejected (operations were unsuccesful). Adding .then() to a promise allows you to define the actions to be carried out after the promise is complete.

## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?

- No, callbacks can be used as asynchronous funtions but are not asynchronous by default.
