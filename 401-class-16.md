# AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
    - client sends an HTTP request to access a resource on a server
    - the server sends a response to the client, indicating if the request was fullfilled or there was an error

2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
    - hardware or software that responds to client by carrying out HTTP requests
3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
    - running/hosting an app on a server

## Vocab Terms
