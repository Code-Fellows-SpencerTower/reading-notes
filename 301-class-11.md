[SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained with few Example DB](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL	NoSQL
1. SQL are called 'relational dbs' vs NoSQL are 'non-relational dbs'
2. SQL is table-based vs NoSQL is document-based, with key-value pairs and has no specific schema to adhere to
3. SQL: vertically scalable vs NoSQL: horizonally scalable
4. SQL handles high loads, more stable, which makes it better for heavy transaction-based applications
5. SQL: ACID principles: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability. vs NoSQL: Brewers CAP: Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance 


1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    - transactional data
2. Give a real world example.
    - Amazon.com
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    - .json files
4. Give a real world example.
    - Craigslist, The New York Times
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    - SQL - vertically scalable
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
    - NoSQL - can easily add more servers to handle more traffic

1. What does SQL stand for?
    - Structured Query Language
2. What is a realational database?
    - a collection of data items that have pre-defined relationships, eg a table with columns and rows
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
    - tables with columns and rows
4. What is a ‘schema’?
    - an outline of how the data in a relational database is organized
5. What is a NoSQL database?
    - "not only SQL"
    - databases that do not store data in tables
    - can be document-based, key-value stores, wide-column, graphs
6. How does it work?
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
    - JSON-like documents that have optional schemas
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
    - MongoDB - it is a NoSQL db, which means it is not restricted to tabular format
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    - less stable for heavy transactional-based apps
