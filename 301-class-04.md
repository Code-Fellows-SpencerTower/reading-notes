# Forms

[React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
    - a component that renders a form and also controls the state of the form, depending on user input
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
    - Update the state with responses as they enter them. The point is to be able to update the state as the user gives input. This allows the displayed value to update while the user is typing.
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
    - The handlChange function responds to user keystrokes and updates the state with each keystroke

[The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
    - it allows us to use the logic of an 'if' statement on a single line of code
    - ternary operator syntax: `condition ? value if true : value if false`
2. 
if statement:
```JS
if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
  ```
ternary operator:
```JS
x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false); 
```

# Things I want to know more about
- cases where you would want to use an if statement over a ternary operator
- using handleChange to update state based on user keystrokes
