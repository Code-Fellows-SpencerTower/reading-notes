## Programming with JavaScript

- chained expressions are evaluated from right to left

## Functions
- a sequence of statements to perform a task
- takes input and returns output
- declared with the `function` keyword
- the function keyword is followed by the function name, parentheses enclose the arguments, curly brackets enclose the function statements, each statment is followed by a semicolon
- function names can include letters, unterscores, dollar signs, and digits
- functions are invoked with the () operator


Function syntax:
```JavaScript
    function add(a, b) {
        return a + b
    }
```


## Control Flow

- the order statements are executed in a script
- code is run from the first to last line in a script
- conditionals and loops will change the control flow
