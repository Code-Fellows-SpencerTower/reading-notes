# Redux - Combined Reducers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
    - Redux dev tools make debuggin easier
    - Redux requires more setup, but is easier to extend with new data and actions after that setup is in place
    - UI and state management logic are separated in redux

    - JS objects with a type field
    - describe something that happened in the application

1. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
    - becuase state is immutable, so we need to create a new object to create a new state
