## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
    - makes it easier to transmit when it is broken down into smaller packeds and then is reassembled at its destination
2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
    - because there is no prior arrangement made between the two endpoints
    - the sender sends data without checking to see if the sender is ready to receive or if there is a reciever at all.
