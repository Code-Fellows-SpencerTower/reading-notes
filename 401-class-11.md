# Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is access control important?
    - it creates a security layer that restricts user access to resources
2. Describe an application that would need access control.
    - a forum - varying levels of access would allow different users access to different resources and perform different actions on the forum
3. What is a role used for?
    - roles assigned to a user that define the capabilities given to the user
4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
    - in RRBC, users are given access based on their role, the permissions remain the same for all users within that role
    - in mandatory access control there are more classification categories for resources and users, requiring more maintenance and overhead
