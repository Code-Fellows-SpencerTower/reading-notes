## HTML Basics
- HTML creates the structure for a webpage
- content is wrapped with opening and closing tags
- Attributes - privide additional information about an element
- <!DOCTYPE html> - defines the doc as html
- <html></html> - aka "root element", wraps the entire page
- <head></head> - wraps content not shown to user
- <meta charset="utf-8"> - defines the character type used in the document
- <title></title> - defines the title of the webpage
- <body></body> - contains all content shown to user
- <img src="image location" alt="image description">
- <a href="address">Link Title</a>

## HTML Semantics
- refers to the purpose of code or an element
- e.g. <h1> makes content into the top level header of the page
- Use of semantics influences search engine rankings
- makes it easier for visually imparied individuals to use the page
- easier to navigate code
