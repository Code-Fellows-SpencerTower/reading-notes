# Data Modeling

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
    - makes code easier to maintain
    - easier to refactor code
    - less debugging
2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
    - if you are modifying an object or structure in your tests
    - beforeEach() can be used to create a new structure for each test, afterEach() used to remove changes made
    - isolates each test so modifications dont carry over to the next test
    source: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21418580/what-is-the-difference-between-before-and-beforeeach#:~:text=If%20each%20test%20in%20your,to%20tear%20it%20down%20cleanly.)
3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
    - tests themselves have to be maintained
4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    - class defines a type which can be 
5. Why REST?
    - more flexible
    - provides an architecture that allows the developer to define its implementation
