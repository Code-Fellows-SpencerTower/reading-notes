# Express

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What’s the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?
    - Both are used to update data on the server
    - `PUT` updates the whole resource. Can create resources, similar to how `POST` works, but can only do so if there is a defined URI
    - `PATCH` only updates part of the resource. Cannot create resources
2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like `json-server`
    - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
    - [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)
    - [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io)
3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
    - both are API documentation tools
    - Swagger - used for implementing OpenAPI specification
    - APIDoc.js - "creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code" - [apidocjs.com](https://apidocjs.com/)

4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
    - Both used to define how APIs should be built
    - SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
      - protocol so it has built-in rules
      - makes it more rigid
    - REST - Representational State Transfer
      - more recent
      - architectural principles vs protocol
      - used for lightweight web services and mobile apps
      - more flexible - allows implementation of its recommendations up to developers
