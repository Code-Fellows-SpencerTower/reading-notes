# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- How granular should your reducers be?
  - depends on what you need to use them for
- Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
  - Usually a pro, sometimes you want multiple reducers responding to the same action
- Name a strategy for preventing the above
  - using the combineReducer function

## Vocabulary Terms

- store
  - where the immutable 'state tree' of the application is held
  - can only be changed by dispatching an action on it
  - to create the store, you have to pass your root reducing function in to the createStore redux function
  - source: [https://redux.js.org/api/store](https://redux.js.org/api/store)
- combined reducers
  - combines reducers together in a single redux reduceer, and allows you to access them individually, since redux technically only allows you to have a single reducer
