[Microsoft Employees Protest Work With ICE, as Tech Industry Mobilizes Over Immigration](https://web.archive.org/web/20211210024957/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html)

I agree with the article. This was a disturbing read. I think it is appaling that decision makers at Microsoft found it acceptable to put profit over destroying families by working with ICE. It is encouraging that employees stood up and took action against these poilicies by protesting within the company and raising funds for families affected. I also agree with the outraged Microsoft employees that the response from Microsoft regarding the issue does not go far enough. I would second that the company should be open to review of its domestic and international government contracts if it really wants to demonstrate that it is not involved in any other contracts that violate human rights.

[BIG DATA IS OUR GENERATION’S CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE, AND WE DON’T KNOW IT](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)

I agree with the statement that a lack of control over how data is used and collected is where the invasion of privacy comes into play. Especially disturbing is the case that data collected can be used to determine characteristics sush as a persons race, sex, religion, etc and be implemented in a descriminatory way. I appreciate the balance brought in at the end of the article, pointing out that big data is used for things like detecting disease outbreaks. It comes down to how the data is being collected and utilized. Overall I think that the article does a good job at highlighting some of the pitfalls of big data.
