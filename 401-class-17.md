# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe “The Cloud”
    - data storage centers that host web services
    - hardware running virtual machines to host apps
2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
    - an object containing an applications source code, configs, and dependencies
3. What is auto-scaling?
    - dynamic allocation of computing resources
    - source: [avinetworks.com](https://avinetworks.com/glossary/auto-scaling/)
4. What is bandwidth?
    - the amount of data transmitted per second
5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
    - costs are calculated based on the type of hardware/software used, how many requests are recieved by the server can affect the cost
    - aws is a pay-as-you-go service
    - AWS EC2 pricing is based on four components:
      - the instance type you choose (EC2 has 40+ types)
      - the region your instances are based in
      - the operating system you run
      - pricing model you select (on-demand instances, reserved capacity, spot, etc.)

## Vocab Terms

- Server Instances - an instance of a server running an application - eg a virtual server
- Containers
  - package your apps code, configs, and dependencies into a single object
  - make it easy to deploy an app
  - source: [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/deep-dive-containers/)
- Cloud Services - the services available on a cloud-based platform - for hosting services this can be data storage and computing resources
- Cloud Architecture - the way that virtualization technology is combined to create a network
- AWS - web hosting services
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku - Heroku is a 'wrapper' for EC2/Beanstalk that does the EC2/Beanstalk configurtion for you when you want to deploy and app
