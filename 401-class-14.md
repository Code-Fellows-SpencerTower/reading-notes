# Event Driven Architecture

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    - Standard queues can send messages multiple times, fifo queues only send once, it remains available until the recipient deletes the message
2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    - the recipient sends back a confirmation
3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
    - an order processing system
4. How do you test an event driven system?
    - unit tests, service tests, end-to-end tests

## Vocab Terms

- FIFO Queue - messages are sent once and remain available until the recipient receives and deletes it
- Pub/Sub - publish / subscribe - used in socket.io to send / recieve messages
