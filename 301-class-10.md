# Call Stack & Debugging

[Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)

1. What is a ‘call’?
    - a function invocation
    - callstack: mostly used for function invocation calls
    - Uses Last in First Out principle
    - last one to be added to the stack is the first one to be popped out
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
    - one call at a time
    - call stacks are synchronous
    - imortant to understand how call stacks work for Asynchronous programming
3. What does LIFO mean?
    - Last in First Out
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
5. What causes a Stack Overflow?
    - if there is a recursive function that has no exit point
    - continually calls itself

[JavaScript error messages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)

1. What is a ‘refrence error’?
    - when you try to use an undeclared variable
2. What is a ‘syntax error’?
    - there is an error with the syntax, eg punctuation
3. What is a ‘range error’?
    - if you try to manipulate an object with invalid length
4. What is a ‘type error’?
    -  when types of objects are incompatible, eg an undefined type
    - often happens if object hasnt been declared yet and its type is undefined
5. What is a breakpoint?
    - stops the code from running at that point if a condition is true
6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
    - adds a breakpoint
