## Dynamic web pages with JavaScript


- JavaScript is an interpreted, lightweight language

- the `value` method returns text that the user has entered
- `let`, `var`, and `const` can be used to declare js variables
- unique names to identify JavaScript variable are called "identifiers"
- identifiers are case sensitive
- identifiers must begin with a letter, $, or underscore
- JavaScript embedded in html is wrapped with `<script></script>` tags

**Variable declaration**
``` JavaScript
    let carType = "Subaru";
```

- you can also declare multiple variables in the same statement, each one separated by a comma:

**Multiple variables in same statement**
``` JavaScript
    let carType = "Subaru",
    carYear = "2020",
    carMiles = "10,000";
```
