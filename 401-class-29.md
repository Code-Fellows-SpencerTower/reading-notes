# Advanced State with Reducers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?
    - use the second parameter - you can pass in any state/props, the effect hook will check to see if this has changed before running.
2. Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?
    - Yes, you can use arrays or objects as the state which allows you to update multiple values at the same time.
3. Is useState() synchronous?
    - No, it's asynchronous

## Vocab Terms

- State Hook
  - `useState()` lets you add state to function components, needs to be imported from react, an initial value can be passed into the `useState()` parentheses
  - can declare a new state variable and function to update it via deconstruction:
    - `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`

- Component Lifecycle
  - The component lifecycle consists of mounting the component, updating the component, and dismounting the component
